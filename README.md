# Ambisonic Toolkit Matrices

A set of matrix files for matrix encoders and decoders.



## Using Matrices with Reaper

The kernels will be included as part of the [ATK for Reaper](http://ambisonictoolkit.github.io/download/reaper/) install, and there is no need to download and install the kernels seperately.



## Using Matrices with SuperCollider

Information is forthcoming.
